# Central Concepts

1. Code will be read and modified more than it will be written.
2. Refactoring becomes riskier when performed informally or ad hoc.
3. To avoid digging your own grave, refactoring must be done systematically.
4. Refactor towards a better design and improved Separation of Concerns.
5. And even more importantly, refactor towards understanding.
